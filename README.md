# Smart_City_App
With government making efforts to improve the standard of living in metropolitan cities it is the duty
of citizens to help maintain our cities. In our day to day life we face issues like power cuts, less
water supplied, error in bills etc. the solution of these problems can only be solved if the
residents approach their local service centers where to lodge a complaint one will have to face
long queues and waste a significant amount of time. This is where the Smart city: complaints &amp;
suggestions app can be useful. The goal of this app is to give resident the ease of lodging
complaints and giving suggestions in various government departments. This app will speed up
the process and delivering solutions to problems will be easy and efficient. The goal of creating
this app is to organize and get quick help to users from the correct departments. Steps like these
will essentially help us to make our cities smart.
